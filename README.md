## Design Process: 
This webiste is for people who forgets about their friends or relative's birthday dates. Allowing them to remember the dates, and if they are unsure of what to buy for them, there are also some ideas for them to pick. They will not get anxiety when they found out that today is someone's birthday. After getting the feedbacks from my mentor, friends and family, I added more stuffs, to have the background images that are relevant to birthdays.
